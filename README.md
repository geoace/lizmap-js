# lizmap-js

This is a series of custom javascript operations created to extend the functionality of Lizmap Web Client. 

#### For the 3liz-endorsed javascript repository, go here: https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-javascript-scripts

#### For documentation on how to implement javascript on your projects, click here (note you may need to select the most recent Lizmap version): https://docs.lizmap.com/3.6/en/publish/customization/javascript.html


For descriptions of each function, see below.

## edit_default.js

This tool will open an attribute (i.e., edit) form by default rather than the standard popup. Note that all users who access the map will need to have edit access to see the full functionality. One way around this is to use the atlas tool for your popup. The edit tool will simultaneously open while the atlas panel will remain open as well.

## google_street_view

Taken from the main lizmap javascript repository (https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-javascript-scripts). Adds a google street view button on the web app menu and provides a google street view popup window when used (with option to view full screen in google maps on a separate tab).
